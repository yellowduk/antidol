# Anti-Judol Tools 🇮🇩

Small open-source tools to help block or reduce **judi online (judol)** in Indonesia.

This repo may include things like:
- 🔒 small Android blocker (VPN or accessibility)
- 🌐 judol domain blocklist (based on AKBXR)
- 📌 simple awareness website or info page
- 🖨️ auto-generated anti-judol posters (print campaign)
- 📸 community pinboard for documented posters in public
- 💬 maybe a simple reporting/chatbot in the future

> ⚠️ This is not a big organization. Not sure if it is going anywhere.  
> Just small tools built step-by-step. Everything is free and open-source.
